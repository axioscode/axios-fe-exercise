# Axios Front End Excerise

Axios has a lot of award-winning journalism, and sometimes it doesn't all fit on one page, so we have to help readers easily find and read the stories they want . One of the ways we can do that is with a [Carousel](http://ui-patterns.com/patterns/Carousel), a user interface pattern that allows users to navigate between various stories while displaying a simple overview for each.

Our design team has supplied the following design for a Carousel. Your task is to build it.

We've set up the skeleton of an application for you, but there's still plenty of decisions to make.

## Before you start

We're not trying to get you to work for us for free, so please don't spend than more than 4 hours on this. Seriously. We already have a Carousel component ðŸ˜‰

You can write a `TODO` doc that explains how you'd complete any tasks you don't get to.

## Getting started

1. Fork this repo to begin the exercise.
2. In index.html, rebuild the mocks in the Figma design in semantic HTML, CSS and JS.
3. First make a call to the `stream endpoint` to retrieve an array of the 10 lastest story ids for Axios.com.
4. For each story id, make another call to the `content endpoint` to retrieve the data for each story.
5. Based on the mocks provided, build a carousel that displays up to 10 stories that includes the following:
- The `headline` of the story.
- The 16x9 cropped `cover image`.
- The `display name` for the author.
- The `published date` of the story.
- Link out the cover image and `Go Deeper` using the `permalink` returned by the API.

These are the endpoints you'll need to populate your Carousel:

### Stream endpoint
https://api.axios.com/api/render/stream/content

This returns metadata about 10 stories.

### Content endpoint
https://api.axios.com/api/render/content/c13dbda5-893d-46ba-ae6a-87ff8e34c74e

This returns the content and detail of one story, from its UUID. 

## Details

- When landing on the page, the first story should be visible.
- When clicking through the Carousel, the headline, cover image, display name, and published date should all change.
- Clicking on an item in the Carousel should open that story on axios.com in a new tab.
- The `Visit axios.com` button should link to [https://www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com).

## Suggestions

- We're big fans of HTML5 semantic elements.

- We prefer tend to prefer functional components over classes, and [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) where necessary.

- You can use any data fetching library you like. [Fetch](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch), [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) (heh) or [SWR](https://github.com/vercel/swr) will all do just fine.

- We care about accessibility. Please make your page as accessible as possible.

- There are layouts for a smaller screen and a larger screen. We'd love to see a responsive page that works for both. The minimum width of the screen is 375px. The horizontal breakpoint is at 980px.

- Building software is a collaborative process, so if you're feeling adventurous, feel free to diverge from the designs somewhat and apply your own creativity. Let us know about the choices you made, and why.

- The application has jest already set up. Add the amount of test coverage you feel is appropriate.

- We use TypeScript at Axios. Bonus points if you define types and use them effectively to increase the reliability of your code.
